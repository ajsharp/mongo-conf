DESCRIPTION
===========
Simple collection of scripts for configuring, installing, and running mongo db.


USAGE
=====
On your remote box running Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS, simply copy 
etc/init.d/mongod.centos to /etc/init.d/mongod on your remote box.

Also, copy ./etc/mongodb.conf to /etc/mongodb.conf. You can add any command
line options here, rather than modifying the init script.


INSTALL
=======
The easy way: from the repo root, simply run ./installer

Or, if you prefer to do it manually:

To install mongod as a service, you need to run the following command:
/sbin/chkconfig mongod on

To check that mongo has successfully been installed as a service run the following:

/sbin/chkconfig --list | grep mongod

If all has gone correctly, you should see the following line (or something similar):

mongod          0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off
